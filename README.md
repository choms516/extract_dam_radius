# extract_dam_radius

This repository includes a code used in the paper: 

- P.Fan, M.Cho, Z.Lin, Z.Ouyang, J.Qi, J.Chen, & E.Moran (submission), Recently constructed hydropower dams reduced economic production, population, and greenness in nearby areas, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

The code is extracting values from satellite images and gridded dataset within the radius (0-5, 5-20, 20-50, and 50-60km) and cacluating the differences between T1 (before dam) and T2 (after dam) using the Google Earth Engine.
